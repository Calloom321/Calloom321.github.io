# About
This is a repository for me to share the projects & code that I am working on, code that has interested or inspired me and a place for me to share thoughts and feelings I've had along the way. These topics can be found in their own sections below.

## Projects

### Basic Login System - Python


[https://github.com/Calloom321/hashLoginSystem](https://github.com/Calloom321/hashLoginSystem)

```markdown
I got bored one day and decided to try and make a login system in python. 
It slowly progressed from not being able to store accounts to being able to store 
accounts with a password being hashed in Sha512 using public python libraries.

```

## Interesting Code

[https://github.com/MatrixTM/MHDDoS/blob/main/start.py](https://github.com/MatrixTM/MHDDoS/blob/main/start.py)

```markdown
I was browsing the github trending page looking for some cool projects and
came across this python code for DDoSing. Given that I'd potentially like
to go into the cyber security industry I thought I'd have a look at it. 
The code is written in Python which I thought I had a good understanding 
of when going to analyse the code. It turned out, I had no idea what was
happening. The code's quite complex and a lot of it is beyond my understanding,
however, it seems quite cool. This code may be something I return to later on
when I've furthered my knowledge.
```

## Reflective Prompts

### Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this week? How often? Did you stretch your body?

Every hour of study I would get up and grab a drink. At home I have a motorised desk which I rotate between standing up and sitting down
each hour.

### What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?

I hadn't heard of timeboxing until prompted here. After a bit of research I've come to the understanding that it's a tool used for managing time
and maximizing productivity. I feel like I'm managing time quite well at the moment so it's not something I need. However, if I start to feel
like I'm falling behind I wouldn't be aposed it. I guess it's just circumstantial.

### On a a 0-5 scale, how confident are you with each of the assignments?

On average I'd say give my confidence a 4. I found a few of the assignments a little confusing (including this one at first)
However, for the most part I'd say I'm going good.

### Do you have a personal learning strategy? If so, what parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face? If you don't have a personal strategy yet, what do you think might work? Invent and describe a strategy for yourself. 

When we sleep we process all of the information we've learned that day. Studies have shown that taking in information while this
process is occuring can help to learn things. When I just can't get something through my head I tend to try and listen to something related
to that topic while I sleep. This can be something like a podcast. 

Other than this, I just try to read over things several times. I think I'm a visual learner so I try to watch videos and then recreate
what I watched. When it comes to code I try and find something similar to what I'm coding and watch a video on it. This means I won't be
completely stealing the persons code however I can use it to think and develope my own ideas from.


### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this course, what would it say?

"Don't over complicate things"
That's it. I'm an over thinker, and because of it I tend to over complicate things and make them way harder than they need to be.
Sometimes this is a good thing because it gets my ideas bouncing but a lot of the time it can be an inconvenience.

### What is Python?

Most people would say it's a coding language used to create programs / software.
I'd say it's one of many tools that can be used to express ideas. You can do a lot in python and it allows people to get creative, express
their interests and create cool things.

### Have you developed a habit of exploring?

I think I've developed a habit of exploring. I seem to have found myself browing the github trending page a lot more than I used to. 
In fact, before this course I didn't even know it existed. 

### Have you meditated before?

I haven't meditated however I've done breathing excersizes. I used to do Kung Fu and and before every single class we'd do a Tai Chi
breathing excersize. Although I no longer go, I still use the breathing technique when I'm angry or frustrated. Sometimes I even just do
it in the morning to get my day going.

### Do you consider yourself a developer yet?

This question is entirely dependant on how you define the word "developer"
To me, development is the act of taking an idea and expanding on it. It doesn't have to be code or something technoligcally
related. Painting is an excellent example, think about how a basic idea grows and turns into an inspiring painting. Almost everyone
gets ideas and expands on them. Because of this, I'd consider everyone (including myself) a developer.

### Do you value creativity? As a value itself? What about as a tool for learning to think logically?

I think creativity is a really important skill to have. When trying to learn you can come across and experience lots of issues
and complications. Being creative allows for solutions and work around to be made. I'd absolutely say I value it and I'll say
with 100% confidence that it's an excellent skill to have when learning new things.

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?

4 tabs in 1 windows and 4 in another, for a total of 8. All 8 of the tabs are study related.

### What is an IDE?

An IDE is a tool used to write programs. An IDE takes common development tools and compiles them into one, easy to use graphical user interface

### So far, what was the hardest moment of this course for you?

### What is OOP?

Object Orientated Programming (OOP) is a programming method that uses the concept of clases and objects. OOP is used to simplify re-usable
pieces of code and create blueprints for the creation of individual instances of objects.

### Are you using the canvas content? Do you find it helpful or tedious?

I have been checking canvas often for help and instructions. I don't find it tedious but I don't always find it helpful either.
Sometimes it's helpful, sometimes I'm still left confused.

### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?

None. As stated above I didn't really find anything on canvas tedious.

### What is polymorphism?

I'd define polymorphism as something being able to be percieved in more than one way or form. 'poly' meaning many and 'morphism' meaning forms 
or versions.
In coding, polymorphism could be creating code that allows for the performance of an action in several different ways.

### What is an MVP? How would you describe it to a group of 6 year olds?

Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a version of a good or service which has enough features to function and be usable by early customers whom
can provide feedback for improvement. 

When explaining things to people, I try and take something they know and use it as an analogy for explaining something new.
I'd start by finding out the interests of the group of 6 year olds and try and use it as an example. 

I've thought of two analogies I can use to explain MVP. The first one being; sandcastles.

Imagine you have a bucket, fill it with sand, flip it upside down, empty it and you have a singular "lump" which is a castle.
This is enough to make it a castle. It's quite simple, however can be used and defined as a sand castle. From here you can add
another lump, expanding the castle. The castle was usable with 1 hump however adding a 2nd adds complexity. Then you can add another
lump on top and can keep expanding.

The 2nd analogy I thought of is; building a house in minecraft.

All you need is wooden planks and a door and you can create a house. It's not a great house but by definition, it's a house.
You can then use wooden logs to create support beams. Add a slanted roof. Add depth etc. Even though as a wooden box it was a house and functioned,
it wasn't a complex palace.

### What is pair programming?

Pair programming is the act of two people working together on one program. However, it's done at a singular work station. One person tends to
write the code while the other tends to anayse and review each line as it's written.

### What are you looking forward to learning about programming?

More languages. I think there being multiple coding languages is really cool. They're all used to express ideas and creation in different
ways. I'd like to be able to understand peoples goals and visions, no matter which language they are wrote in.

### What programming languages are you interested in learning? Why?

As many as I can. See the section above.

### What is conscious listening?

Imagine a teacher is teaching a subject your not very interested in. It causes you to be dis-interested and zone out. Now, imagine a
teacher is teaching something you are interested in. You're just 'there' right? You're focused, you're paying attention and taking in 
information. That's conscious listening. It's the act of intentionally being persent during communications.

### What is a variable?

When someone thinks of the word 'variable' they usually think of something that can change. This makes sense because when something 
'varies', it changes. However, a variable is a placeholder. It's a way to represent something and it doesn't always have to change
or be able to change. For example: constant variables in statistics or a constant in coding.

In terms of coding, I'd define a variable as a stored characteristic, number or quatity which can be used to performs programming
actions.

### What is something kind that someone has done for you?

Family making me Tea and/or bringing me food when I'm sick.

### If you were describing programming to someone who knows nothing about it, what would you say?

I would describe it as writing out an idea and expanding on it to create something cool.

### Which parts of this course made you feel doubtful of your own innate ability?



### What is a fixed mindset?

When I think of the word 'fixed' I think 'static' or 'doesn't change'
Based on this I would say that a fixed mindset is having an opinion about something which doesn't change nor can be changed.

### What is something kind you have done for someone else?

Yesterday I picked up a mate from the airport and drove him home after he'd been away

### Have you done mindfulness or attention training before?

I don't believe I have. I am however open to it if the opportunity or reason arrises.

### Have you developed a habit of persevering?

Yes and no.
When something gets hard I don't give up. However, I do often get frustrated and walk away. I then come back to it later on with a clear
head and keep going.
