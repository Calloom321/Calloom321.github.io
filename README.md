```markdown
I got bored one day and decided to try and make a login system in python. 
It slowly progressed from not being able to store accounts to being able to store 
accounts with a password being hashed in Sha512 using public python libraries.

## Interesting Code

[https://github.com/MatrixTM/MHDDoS/blob/main/start.py](https://github.com/MatrixTM/MHDDoS/blob/main/start.py)

```markdown
I was browsing the github trending page looking for some cool projects and
came across this python code for DDoSing. Given that I'd potentially like
to go into the cyber security industry I thought I'd have a look at it. 
The code is written in Python which I thought I had a good understanding 
of when going to analyse the code. It turned out, I had no idea what was
happening. The code's quite complex and a lot of it is beyond my understanding,
however, it seems quite cool.
